# Patatap Clone
This is a simplified version of the patatap.com web application. Using Howler.js to play audio files and Paper.js to create the visualization. Each letter key on the keyboard plays a different sound. The circles position are randomly generated, but the starting hue is constant for each letter/sound.

Here is a demo video:
